# AstroCore


### What's this?
Pure Python top-down RPG game made in PyGame library.

### What state is it in?
Currently, this game is WIP - Public Beta, but I'm working on adding tons of new modules. I'm also constantly working on bug fixes.

### Any story?
I mean yea, but still wasn't added into the game xD

### How can I play test this?
If you have Python and PyCharm IDE installed:
- Create new workspace (with virtual enviroment)
- Unzip latest Relase into your Workspace folder -> Don't forget to overwrite venv folder
- Start `astrocore.py` file

### I will be more then happy if you would help me find and fix bugs, I also want to hear your suggestions!
